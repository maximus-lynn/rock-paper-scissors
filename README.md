This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## How to use
You will need to pull down the repo to your computer in your terminal using:
`git clone https://github.com/maximus-lynn/rock-paper-scissors.git`

You'll need to `cd` into `rock-paper-scissors`.

Run `npm install` once this is complete run `npm start`. 

This will then open up a new tab in your browser with the react project for you to navigate through. If this does not work please make sure you have `create-react-app` installed globally by running this command `npm install -g create-react-app`.

## My approach
I approached the test by starting off with a pen and paper. Wireframing out the layout allowed me to work on more specific sections of the game and to understand the end goal. 

I felt to get the project up and running quickly that `create-react-app` was a great way of doing this.

I decided to use React instead of a Framework like Angular that I was more familiar with to give me more of an understanding. I believe that these tests are a good opportunity to learn as much as they are to be tested.

## If I had more time
I would create a total score of the amount of times the computer and user have won for a clear winner over multiple rounds.

I'd look into writing tests with React, something that I haven't done yet. 

I'd also like to spend more time on the design and UX to reduce the amount of clicks involved.
